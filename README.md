## Settings

If you want to setup the testnet with ganache,
please uncomment following code:

```bash
  networks: {
        development: {
            host: "127.0.0.1",
            port: 7545,
            network_id: "*"
        },
        test: {
            host: "127.0.0.1",
            port: 7545,
            network_id: "*"
        }
    },
```

It will make sure it uses ganache as testnet.

## ENJOY!
